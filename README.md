# Automatic Increment Counter

Automatically increment numeric counters with a smooth animation effect.

## Overview
This JavaScript project features a set of counters that increment automatically to a specified target value. The counters are implemented with a smooth animation, providing a visually appealing way to showcase increasing numbers.

## Usage
1. Include the `main.js` script in your HTML file.

    ```html
    <script src="main.js"></script>
    ```

2. Add the `counter` class to HTML elements that you want to turn into automatic increment counters.

    ```html
    <span class="counter" data-target="100">0</span>
    ```

    Adjust the `data-target` attribute to set the target value for each counter.

3. Open your HTML file in a web browser and observe the automatic incrementing effect.

## How It Works
The counters start from zero and increment smoothly to a specified target value. The animation is achieved using a recursive function and the `setTimeout` function for a gradual increase.

Feel free to integrate this project into your web applications to add an engaging counter feature.
